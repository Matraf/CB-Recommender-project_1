## 1. Description

The aim of the project was to implement content-based recommender and train it using different machine learning algorithms.

## 2. Requirements

Requirements are ```environment.yml```. To run enter following commands:
```bash
conda env create --name rs-class-env -f environment.yml
conda activate rs-class-env
```

## 3. Overall score

Due to bad implementation it was too time and memoryconsuming to train my recommender with different ML algorithms.
